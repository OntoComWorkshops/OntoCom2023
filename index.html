    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        The International Workshop on Ontologies and Conceptual Modelling (OntoCom) is an academic workshop that concerns the practical and formal application of ontologies to conceptual modelling. While models pervade the information systems lifecycle from requirements to implementation, there appears to be a lack of theoretical foundation in the way that models are developed. As a result it is quite common for practitioners, even working together, to produce different representations of the same real world domain or system. Conversely, a preferred approach would be one in which IS practitioners have the necessary conceptual tools to enable them to accurately represent the things that exist in the real world. Foundational or upper ontologies have the potential to resolve the difficult problems that derive from a lack of a consistent and sound ontological theory. The benefits that can derive from the application of a foundational ontology include improved mapping to the real world domain, increased level of communication and understanding among stakeholders, model reuse, semantic integration and interoperability and increased overall efficiency and effectiveness of information systems development and evolution.

The theme of OntoCom will continue to be Foundational Ontologies and their Meta-ontological Choices. The workshop will be practically oriented and discussions will be centred on models produced for different kinds of case studies. More specifically, we intend to provide several case studies that each focus on a concrete modelling problem. Next, during our workshop, we would discuss and clarify each of these case studies using several different foundational ontologies. The purpose of this discussion is to discover and evaluate how the different ontologies would distinguish themselves in representing each of these case studies and their respective problems. Consequently, this would lead to highly interesting discussions between experts of different kinds of ontologies. As such, this workshop is aimed at providing a platform to stimulate high expert discussions concerning the application of different kinds of foundational ontologies to a set of distinct modelling problems. 

The structure of the workshop would thus be as followed: we would accept contributions that concern the above-mentioned topics (or even on topics related to the main workshop theme) and demonstrate these contributions during SLAM sessions, or short power point presentations that explain the main idea of the paper. Contributions in the form of research, research-in-progress papers and practitioner reports are welcome. Next, our sessions would be focused on presenting several case studies and possible interpretations of these case studies by various foundational ontologies. Together with the audience, we would then discuss the advantages, disadvantages, main distinctions and possible changes in each of these representations by the foundational ontologies.

        Here&rsquo;s a good place to list the organizers and sponsors of the conference,
        as well as list contact information for the organizers,
        and show off the logos of the sponsors.
        It looks like his conference was sponsored by kittens!
